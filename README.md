# iRacingThumbnails

Racing spotter guides take a long time to create. Typically about 2 hours to get proper images and format everything correctly. This tool will do all of the heavy lifting within 2 minutes.

The iRacing Thumbnails project is a program meant to automatically create spotter guides like one shown here: http://tiny.cc/formulaindy.

Using the iRacing SDK and Game, this program will automatically apply any custom paint onto the thumbnail model of the car selected from the GUI. 
This loops through all drivers that are on track in an iRacing session or replay.
An image of their car is placed on a transparent background. Once all the images are created, they are merged into one large image.
The number of columns is specified from the GUI. The car number and driver name is automatically printed onto the image as well.
Apply a custom background and the spotter guide is done!
